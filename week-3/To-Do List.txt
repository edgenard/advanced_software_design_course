To-Do List

Your task is to design the data layer for a to-do list app. For inspiration, here's 40 examples. Create the core data structures that track state, along with an API that can be connected to any frontend (command-line, web, desktop GUI, etc).
Initial Design

In the basic version, a task is either done or not done. A user should be able to create and delete todo items, view the list to do, and mark items as done.

Create Item
Delete Item
View List
Mark Done

First round of feature requests

Extend your design to support two of the following features:

    Assigning more statuses to todo items (e.g.: in-progress, under review, blocked)
    Assign priorities to todo items
    Adding stickers to todo items
    Adding due dates to todo items

Make sure your new design makes it easy to filter and display to-do items in whatever way the user may reasonably expect.
