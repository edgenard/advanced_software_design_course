# Hidden Coupling Drill


1. What is the coupling in this example?
2. Is the coupling visible or hidden?
3. If the coupling is hidden, then how can I remove it?


## Example 1

```java
public void foo() {
  bar(1,2,3);
}

public void bar(int a, int b, int c) {
  System.out.println(a+b+c);
}
```

1. `foo` has to know that `bar` takes three arguments. That those arguments are integers.
2. I think the coupling is visible

## Example 2

```c
char *str = "Hello, ";
char *buf = malloc(8+strlen(name));
strcat(buf, str, name);
```

1. `*buf` has to know that `*str` is 8 characters.
2. This coupling is hidden
3. You can remove it by writing something like: `*buf = malloc(strlen(str)+strlen(name))`

## Example 3

```c++
struct Game {
   ....
   Player players[2];
   ....
}


for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  if (game.players[i].isVictorious()) {
      ....
  }
}
```


1. The `for` loop assumes that there are ever only two players. It also has to to know that `isVictorious` is a method on the `Player` object
2. I think the count of players is a hidden coupling but the the method name is visible.
3. The `for` loop could be changed to `for (int i = 0; i < game.players.count(); i++)` You can also not use a `for` loop at all and use something like a `select` or `find` function so iterates over `game.players`
   and returns the first player for which `isVictorious` is true.



## Example 4


```python
def user_history(days=90):
  # Do 90 days of history by default
  for i in xrange(days):
    # do stuff
```

I don't think I see any coupling here. This function seems to be fairly sef-contained.

## Example 5

```java
public class A {
  public void log() {
    ....
    writeLineToFile("log.txt", ...)
    ....
  }
}



public class B {
  public void b() {
    ....
    writeLineToFile("log.txt", ...)
    ....
  }
}
```

1. Since both methods write to the same file, they might overwrite each other. It could be hard to know which method wrote which line.
2. If the classes are close to each other in the code base this coupling could be visible but most likely it's hidden. I bet the only way that this would be found out is through some weird data in the "log.txt" file.
3. To make this coupling visible we could use `A.log` in `B.b`. If that were not possible we could have the knowledge of the which file to write to hidden away somewhere, maybe a `LogWriter` class that just exposes a `write` method and nothing else.


## Example 6

### Server

```python
def handleRequest(request):
  username = request["username"]
  password = request["password"]
  # â€¦
```

### Client

```html
<form ...>
  <input type="text" name="username"></input>
  <input type="text" name="password"></input>
  <button type="submit"></button>
</form>
```

1. The keys, "username" and "password" are coupled between the client and server.
2. I think this coupling is visible.
3. I don't think it can be removed. We can add validation on the server to alert us if the request doesn't have the expected data but the coupling will still be there.

## Example 7

```python
openFile("prog/imgs/combat_images/MONSTER1.gif");
openFile("prog/imgs/combat_images/FIREBALL.gif");
```

1. The coupling is between the file system or file path and the actual resources needed. For example, this may break if the images are moved.
2. I think this coupling is visible.
3. I think the file path where the images are stored can be a configuration option in the program instead being hard coded. I think this will allow changing the path.

## Example 8

```java
class Rectangle { public int getArea() { ... } }
class Circle { public int getArea() { ... } }

class GraphicsProgram {
   ...
   private Color computeAverageColor() {
     for (Rectangle r : this.rectangles) { ... }
     for (Circle c : this.circles) { ... }
   }
}
```

1. I think the coupling here is that `GraphicProgram` has to know about `Rectangle` and `Circle`. It has to know that both shapes have the `getArea` method.
2. I think this coupling is visible




## Example 9

```java
String[] recipeNames     = { "Fried calamari", "Spaghetti with meatballs", "Apple pie", ... };
RecipeType[] recipeTypes = {APPETIZER, ENTREE, DESSERT, ... }
```

1. I don't think I see any coupling here. Maybe if individual `recipeTypes` are defined with one of the values from `recipeNames` that would couple them however I don't see that here.
