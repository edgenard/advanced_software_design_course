# Questions from readings

## The Algebra of Algebraic Datatypes, Part 1

__Use the laws of this reading to rewrite this type to not have any sums: (int+string) â†’ bool__

I'm not sure what this is asking. I think if I enumerated the possibilites for this type it would look like this:

```
int+string -> true
int+string -> false
string+int -> true
string+int -> false
```

I don't see a way to change this to not have any sums.
