# Sketch

In short it seems that Algebraic Datatypes is about the combination of ways something can end up as.

It's like building a decision table. Sum types will have a table where the number of rows is the sum of all the types. Product types will have the number of rows be the product of all the types.

You can make illegal/invalid states unrepresentable by being more precise about the output of a function/module.
